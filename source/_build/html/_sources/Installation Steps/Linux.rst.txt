Linux
=====

It might be possible to run everything in Windows through Windows 
Subsystem for Linux (WSL), but it might be easier to install and 
troubleshoot a native install of Linux on a computer with an NVIDIA GPU. 
You can dual-boot a computer so you can boot into either Linux or 
Windows natively. 

Ubuntu
======

Ubuntu has a large community and it good for beginners of Linux, so 
troubleshooting should be easier than on other distros. Some installation 
instructions have examples specifically for Ubuntu.  Red Hat Enterprise 
Linux (RHEL) also is a very popular distro and has specific examples 
during installation steps. 

Some software say they require Ubuntu and specifically a long-term support 
(LTS) version like 20.04. For maximum compatibility, I recommend this 
version.
