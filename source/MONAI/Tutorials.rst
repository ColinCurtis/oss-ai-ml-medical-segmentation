MONAI tutorials can be found `on the GitHub page <https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials>`_.

These tutorials require Jupiter Notebooks::

    python -m pip install -U notebook

Some tutorials require optional dependencies, which should have already been installed. In case you get import errors, run::

    pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/dev/requirements-dev.txt
